	/*   sequencing does not matter of annotation you can write it anywhere it will run from own way.
	 *   TESTNG will decide automatically.
	 *   @Before and @After is not dependent to each other but its good practice to use both annotations same time
	 *   
	 *   
	 *   how to handle overloaded method with TESTNG Annotations ?
	 * Ans-Overloaded method generally not given in 
	 * 
	 * priority is applicable only for @Test method not for others.
	 * IF Dependent method has been failed then individual method skipped
	   if two methods having same priority then it will pick 
       if any method id dependent and if we set priority =1 also it wont run until dependent method do not run
	 * Without priority test script will run first later on priority once
